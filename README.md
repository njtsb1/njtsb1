Hi, I'm Nivaldo Beirão

Palmeirense, 33 years old, passionate about trucks, passionate about reading and learning, I try to stay up to date, studying is part of my daily life.

Graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (2017) and a Specialization in Governance and Information Technology Management (2018), both from Centro Universitário do Vale do Ribeira - Unisepe Educacional.

I had to pause my career more than once for parental care, it became unsustainable to reconcile caring for my mother and the demands of my previous job, as much as I liked the job, I felt frustrated and stressed, I concluded that I needed time for my physical and especially mental health.

Having worked professionally for 15 years in the areas of Administration and Information Technology, I had experience in the private sector in a supermarket chain in the Vale do Ribeira region, a cashier at Expresso Bradesco and an Administrative Assistant at the University Center where I graduated.

In the state sector, I worked in the area of ​​education as a Help Desk, technical support, training and management of interns in the Acessa Escola program in both the Education Directorates of Miracatu/SP and Registro/SP.

During the pandemic (2021) I became a Sports Trader at Betfair International, making investments in football games on the Bolsa Esportiva Exchange. I have been taking online courses on the DIO platform, including Bootcamps solving code challenges and project delivery.
