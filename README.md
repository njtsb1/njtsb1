# 👋 Welcome to my profile

## Professional Summary
Graduated in Business Administration and holding an MBA in IT Management, I have a perfectionist, detail‑oriented, analytical, and process‑driven profile. I focus on organization, clear documentation, and practical solutions that ensure operational stability and service continuity. I prioritize quality, rigorous review, and meeting deadlines while maintaining a discreet and reliable demeanor.

## Work Approach and Leadership
I adopt a methodical approach to team and project management, seeking efficiency and continuous improvement. My work emphasizes structured processes, clear communication, and pragmatic problem solving to sustain day‑to‑day operations and support long‑term goals.

## Personal Notes and Objectives
Sometimes shy, sometimes introverted, sometimes reserved; I am 35 years old, am single, have no children, and dedicate part of my time to reading and ongoing study to enhance my technical and management skills. I am looking for opportunities to apply discipline, attention to detail, and commitment in IT and administrative service delivery.
